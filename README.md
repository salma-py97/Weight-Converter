# Weight-Converter
Bootstrap5, vanilla JS.
This app allows the user to input a weight and choose a weight unit and returns the equivalent of that weight in all the other units.
the user gets alerts in case they forget to input the weight or the weight unit.

This app was inspired by Brad Travery who made a simpler version on his youtube channel.
